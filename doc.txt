// Tendem learning 
Tandem learning is a language learning method in which two individuals with different native languages work together 
to learn each other's language. It involves a language exchange partnership, 
where each participant takes turns to teach their partner their own language and learn from their partner's language. 
This method is based on the principle of reciprocal teaching and learning, 
where both participants benefit from each other's knowledge and experience.

In tandem learning, participants can practice listening, speaking, reading, and writing in a supportive environment, 
with a focus on real-life communication and cultural exchange. Tandem learning can take place in person, 
through language exchange programs or language schools, or online through language learning platforms and apps.

Tandem learning is a popular approach to language learning as it provides a personalized learning experience, 
promotes language immersion and cultural exchange, 
and helps build social connections with people from different backgrounds.

// Synopsis
Simple Introduction:
The GPT-3 Tandem Learning Web App is a language learning tool that simulates a conversation with a virtual tandem partner. By using the OpenAI GPT-3 API, the app can provide instant feedback on grammar and vocabulary usage.
Additionally, the GPT-3 Tandem Learning Web App is available in multiple languages, providing users with the opportunity to practice their language skills in a variety of languages.

Existing System:
Traditional language learning methods may not provide immediate feedback on language usage, which can hinder progress. However, the GPT-3 Tandem Learning Web App addresses this issue by providing a virtual conversation partner that corrects any mistakes made and adds new vocabulary/grammar to the conversation.

Proposed System:
The GPT-3 Tandem Learning Web App uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to simulate a conversation with a virtual tandem partner. Every time the user submits a message, the app sends the conversation history to the GPT-3 API, which then replies with a message that corrects any mistakes made and adds new vocabulary/grammar. The app then displays the GPT-3 response. All data is only stored in the user's browser's local storage, ensuring user privacy, and the app communicates directly with the OpenAI API, ensuring reliability.

Modules:
The GPT-3 Tandem Learning Web App has four main modules:
    User Input: Users can input their message to the virtual tandem partner.
    Conversation History: The app keeps track of the conversation history to send to the GPT-3 API for analysis.
    GPT-3 API Integration: The GPT-3 API analyzes the conversation history and responds with a corrected message that includes new vocabulary/grammar.
    Display: The app displays the corrected message from the GPT-3 API in the user interface.

// What ? 
A program that looks like a messenger
one can create a new chat by answering the question: "What did you learn today"
Example answers:
    Room
    The Pratice
A new chat will be created, and the bot asks you an example question about the new vocab / grammar
You can answer and chat with the bot about the new concept and it will correct your mistakes
